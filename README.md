 TANGIBLE INTERFACE FOR LAYERED SOUND ELECTRONICS
</p>

### Description
The systems consist on a physical interface monitored by arduino that allows the user to create sound in Supercollider and apply different modifications through JUCE based plugins. All this supported by a visualizer working on processing.

### Motivation
The objective of this project is to provide unexperienced users an easy aproach to sound synthesis via an easy to use physical interface. Additionally, the physical interface is supported with braille and diferent relieves, enabling users with visual dificulties to freely explore and manipulate the interface.

### Electronics:
This part consists of two differentiated modules, tiles detection and potentiometer measuring. As the number of voltage values to read is higher than the number of analog inputs, we require to use a matrix architecture, dividing the potentiometers and leds in groups (or colums) that can be activated at the moment of reading. This is perfomed by Arduino.

For the tiles detection, we measure the voltage drop of LEDs of different colors. As this values can sometimes be very close, the LED values are constantly being calibrated to avoid undesired alterations. Concerning the conection of the LEDs, it is done with magnets properly polarize to only attach in the right position of the LED.

For the potentiometers, the are in voltaje divider configuration to ensure linear input. Also, diodes are required due to the matrix configuration previously mentioned. This slightly restricts the range of operation.

### Software Components:


#### Arduino:

The purspose of arduino is to read and encode the values obtained from the board. To do this, it first have to coordinate the activation of the different groups to be read. This architecture implies that not every value can be readed in realtime, but the refresh rate for the complete system is below 0.1 seconds, so it is not perceivable by the user.

By reading the LEDs, Arduino can detect which led it is connected, and assign to it the corresponding waveform, effect, or filter. At the same time, arduino is constantly reading the values of the potentiometers. 

Then, arduino correlates the connected tiles with the values in the pots, and via serial port, send the values for each waveform, effect, and filter to the computer in the propper format, where is received by SuperCollider.

#### Supercollider:
SuperCollider works as our core synthesizer, whose parameters (such as the waveform and/or volume) can be controlled externally via the Arduino serial port. It also creates and sends the corresponding OSC messages to be used by the JUCE plugins. For the notes, the protocol MIDI is used as the input for the note playback with parameter controls. Upon execution, the code prepares the SuperCollider server, opens the selected port where the Arduino is connected, and initializes the MIDI system, enabling the program to receive and interpret musical performance data from either an external or virtual MIDI keyboard. This allows for standard note-on and note-off events to trigger and sustain/release sounds.

Simultaneously, the serial data collection routine actively listens for incoming data from the Arduino. A dedicated Routine continuously monitors this port, parsing data packets enclosed between '<' and '>' characters. Once a complete packet is received, it's split by commas, and the individual numeric values are assigned to distinct global variables such as ~volumes, ~adsr, ~fx, ~filters, ~masterVol, and ~pan. This continuous update of parameters means that physical adjustments made on the physical interface (e.g., turning knobs and moving sliders) are immediately reflected in the synthesizer's behavior.

The SynthDef \multiOsc defines the architecture of the polyphonic synthesizer (thus, capable of playing multiple notes concurrently). This includes four fundamental oscillators (sine, pulse, triangular, and saw), whose outputs are mixed together. The amplitude of each oscillator, as well as the overall shape of the note, is modulated by an ADSR envelope (EnvGen), which engages when a MIDI note is pressed and releases when it's lifted. Furthermore, Frequency Modulation (FM) and a Low Frequency Oscillator (LFO) are incorporated to add timbral richness and movement to the sound, controlling the oscillator frequencies and modulating the overall volume, respectively. All these elements are driven by the values constantly received from the serial port, meaning that adjusting each potentiometer on our physical interface alters the sound in real time. Finally, the resulting signal is panned and sent to the audio outputs.

The second script then establishes a series of helper functions to simplify sending OSC messages to JUCE. For the filter plugin, ~setFilter sends a /filter/active message to port 9001, along with the filter's name (e.g., "LPF" for Low Pass Filter) and an active state (1 for on, 0 for off). ~setCutoff sends a /filter/cutoff message, specifying the filter name and its desired frequency. Similarly, for the reverb plugin, ~setWet sends a /wet message to port 9002, controlling the wet/dry mix of the reverberation with a normalized value between 0.0 and 1.0. The distortion plugin is controlled by ~setDrive, which sends a /drive message to port 9003, also with a normalized value to adjust the amount of distortion. By encapsulating these commands in reusable functions, the code becomes cleaner and easier to manage. 

#### JUCE:

The plugin host connection can be seen below:
<p align="center">
  <img src="MEDIA/Plugin.jpg" width="1000" alt="Plugins" />
</p>

##### Distortion:

The JUCE-based audio plugin project implements a real-time distortion effect processor with external OSC control support. The plugin uses the AudioProcessorValueTreeState to manage a single Drive parameter, that controls the intensity of the distortion effect. Internally, the incoming audio signal is first passed through a gain stage that is changed dynamically based on the drive parameter, and then it is processed with to emulate hard clipping, ending with an output gain compensation. 

In order to do this the plugin has an OSC receiver that listens on port 9003 for /drive messages that are sent by SuperCollider with the data received from Arduino, enabling real-time parameter changes from external controllers or visualization interfaces. 

##### Filters:

The Filters plugin is a JUCE-based audio effect that implements real-time multi-mode filtering using a chain of State Variable TPT filters. The plugin processes stereo audio input and allows up to two simultaneous filter types (Low-Pass, High-Pass, Band-Pass, and Notch) to be active at a time, due to the amount of filters that can be setted in the board at the same time. 

Filter parameters, specifically cutoff frequency and filter activation, are controlled dynamically via OSC messages received from SuperCollider. Internally, channels are processed independently to minimize phase artifacts.

The OSC interface listens on port 9001 and supports commands /filter/active and /filter/cutoff to control the signal chain in real time by sending the name of the filter to act on and the assigned value. This plugin serves as a robust foundation for both creative sound design and interactive performance setups.

##### Reverb:

The Reverb plugin is a JUCE-based audio effect that implements a stereo reverb unit with external OSC control integration.

The plugin uses JUCE’s built-in Reverb class, configured with fixed parameters for room size, damping, width, and freeze mode; leaves a single controllable parameter: wetness. This parameter determines the blend between the dry and wet signals and can be adjusted in real time by sending OSC messages on port 9002, using the address /wet. The audio processing applies the reverb directly to the incoming stereo buffer using processStereo, and the OSC receiver updates the wet/dry balance accordingly. 

#### Processing: 
To enhance user interaction and provide visual insight into the sound generated by the synthesizer, we developed a dual-mode graphical interface.

1. Waveform Mode:
In this mode, the interface displays the real-time audio waveform as it is produced by the synthesizer. This allows users to observe the dynamic behavior of the sound in response to various (and mainly) visually-evident parameters such as the ADSR envelope, volume, reverb, and distortion effects. It offers an intuitive way to understand how these elements shape the evolving audio signal.

2. Oscilloscope Mode:
This mode emulates the behavior of a traditional oscilloscope. It captures and displays a fixed-length segment of the waveform, starting from a defined trigger point. By presenting a static view of the waveform, users can more precisely analyze the characteristics of individual waveforms, observe interactions when multiple notes are played simultaneously, and examine how hard-clipping distortion alters the wave-shape.

Both modes receive audio sample data via OSC messages and store them in circular buffers designated for each visualization mode. The waveforms are rendered on-screen along with a grid to support accurate visual interpretation.

#### 3. Load and Configure VST3 Plugins
* Use the Options → Edit the List of Available Plug-Ins menu to scan and load all the VST3 plugins you have developed or plan to use.
* In the graph area: Drag the desired plugins from the list onto the graph canvas and connect them in series (i.e., the output of one plugin feeds into the input of the next).
* Ensure that the final output of the plugin chain is routed to the main output node.

#### 4. Open SuperCollider
* Launch SuperCollider and open your .scd code file.
* Evaluate each code block line-by-line, ensuring no errors appear in the post window.
* Confirm that the audio generated is being sent through the virtual cable (i.e., routed into the JUCE Audio Plugin Host).

#### 5. Test Audio Signal Chain
* Play a sound or trigger a synth in SuperCollider.
* Verify that the audio enters the plugin host and the audio flows correctly through the plugin chain. The processed audio should be audible on your output device.
